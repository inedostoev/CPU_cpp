# CPU

This project presents a processor implementation. 

First of all you should write your program on my asm. All available asm words you can find at `ASM/CPU_CMD.txt`. Put your cmd into `ASM/asmFile.txt`

After that you should translate asm cmd to obj file, this can be done with help `./ASM`. You can look obj file as `ASM/binFile.txt`

To start the processor you need to execute `./CPU`

# Build

`bash buildscript.sh`

# Test

Test programs you can find in `ASM/TestProgram`
